				<h1>Spotify</h1>
				<h2>Spotify is a digital music service that gives you access to millions of songs. It enables you to listen to music on any OS or mobile device, be it iOS or Android. It’s free to use, ad supported, or you can pay for it.</h2>

				<h2>Technical details</h2>
				<p>I love Spotify. I use it every day because it’s a very convenient way of listening to high quality music tracks. Playlists you’ve created sync automatically on all your devices, so you can take your iPod with you when jogging and listen to the music you were listening to on your desktop at the office. Moreover, the artists get paid when you listen to their songs. But the desktop version of the application could be massively improved.</p>

				<p>For those of you who don’t know, here’s how the Spotify desktop app currently looks like:</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-small.jpg" alt="spotify app" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>The actual user interface of the Spotify desktop app; same for OSX and Windows</em></p>

				<p>The biggest problem for me is the <strong>position of the track controls</strong> (stop, next, previous, volume); they reside at the bottom of the app. Being a music player, those controls are the most important function of the app. Why do I have to scan the entire app with my eyes and then find the controls at the bottom? In time, I got used to them there, but it’s not natural to me.</p>

				<p>Most humans read from left to right/top to bottom. We scan in a diagonal fashion. So it’s only natural to place the most important element on the top-left corner, isn’t it?</p>

				<p><img src="../images/work/spotify/reading.jpg" alt="reading humans" /></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>Most of us read from left to right, up to down. Most important element should be on top-left</em></p>

				<h2 class="title">Spotify app redesigned</h2>

				<p>Minding how humans read, and applying other principles as well, here’s my proposed redesigned interface of the app:</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-redesigned.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify//spotify-redesigned-small.jpg" alt="spotify app redesigned" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>The redesigned interface of Spotify’s desktop app</em></p>

				<p>The bright lime-green colour represents the Spotify brand, and it’s being used throughout the interface to accentuate certain elements. As you can see, the top header <strong>hosts the important functions</strong> of the app.</p>

				<p>On the far left there are the track controls “previous”, “play/pause”, “next” with the volume slider. In the centre, a window with the “track/album” title, the seek bar and the “shuffle”, “repeat”, “window-mode” buttons. And on the far right a coverflow showing the cover of the previous track, currently playing track, and next track.</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-large.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-header.jpg" alt="spotify header" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>Volume under track controls, search field in sidebar, tabbed content instead of scrolling</em></p>

				<p>The volume slider was moved under the track controls to reduce clutter and add some breathing space between horizontal elements. The buttons “shuffle”, “repeat”, “window-mode” when turned on, takes on a green colour.</p>

				<p>The search field was moved to the sidebar where all the other parts of the app can be accessed from. The sidebar elements and their icons are almost the same, because I tried to adhere to the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/02_app-design-guidelines.html">Spotify Design Guidelines</a> as much as possible.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Content browsing</h2>

				<p>The content of each section now features a different display format. For example, instead of scrolling through all the categories of the <em>“What’s New”</em> section, now they’re featured as tabs at the top of the content window, below the header (“Top Tracks”, “Top Playlists”, “Recommended Albums”, etc.).</p>

				<p>Besides the tabbed navigation at the top, there are other ways of browsing content. Instead of scrolling through the different album covers, you can now swipe left/right or click the dots at the bottom of the app (visible in the full-size screenshot, above). This can provide a consistent experience across other devices, as this feature could be implemented on touch mobile devices as well.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Window mode</h2>

				<p>A new feature that doesn’t exist in the current version of the desktop app is the “window-mode”. When activated, the sidebar and content area of the app slide up and only the header of the app is shown. This allows for the application to be fully functional without occupying much screen estate. The window can also be resized horizontally to occupy even less screen space than what’s shown below. This idea came to me from Winamp, a music player that allows you to hide certain parts of the app (like the “playlist”, “equalizer”, “library”, etc.).</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-reduced-desktop.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify/spotify-reduced-desktop-small.jpg" alt="spotify desktop reduced" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>The app can run in a smaller window, occupying less screen estate</em></p>

				<h2 class="title">Beautiful ads</h2>

				<p>Let us not forget the ads! In the current app, there are two types of advertisements. The <strong>“obtrusive” ads</strong>, and the <strong>“silent” ads</strong>. The “obtrusive” ads are viewed and listened, i.e. they have sound and music, and kick-in after a certain number of tracks have been played. You can’t skip those ads, or mute them; you can only pause them.</p>

				<p>The other type of ads, the “silent” ads, is simply images that are displayed to the right side, and bottom side of the app. When those ads appear, they push/slide the content to the left, respectively top, to make room. This “jump” that occurs annoys me. What if there was a way to show ads in a better location. </p>

				<p>First, there wouldn’t be two types of ads; only the “obtrusive” type would prevail. That’s the only type of ads I pay attention to anyway (because I have to). I used the central window inside the app that shows the “track/album” title to display the image of the ad. On the right, the opacity of the coverflow with the previous track, currently playing track, and next track is reduced and a friendly message is displayed which explains that music will resume after the ad has finished.</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-large-ads.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify/spotify-app-ads-small.jpg" alt="spotify ads" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>Ads are displayed inside the title-track window. Message is shown and covers are hidden</em></p>

				<p>In the past, when I was familiarising myself with Spotify, I can’t remember how many times I clicked on a song’s title just to get an “angry” yellow notification bar that said to wait for the ad to finish playing first.</p>

				<p>This has had a negative effect on my experience with the application in a way that I’m almost afraid of the application, and avoid clicking anything, whenever it plays ads. In result, this has a negative effect on Spotify, because they want their users to click on the ads.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>

				<p>This was a challenging project to work on because there were many things that had to be taken into account. It wasn’t just an external redesign, making things prettier; I also tried to improve the experience of using the desktop application.</p>

				<p><a href="../images/work/spotify/spotify-sketches.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/work/spotify/spotify-sketches-small.jpg" alt="spotify sketches" /></a></p>
				<p class="sub_photo"><em>Rough sketches (ideas) of the Spotify’s UI</em></p>

				<p>Spotify is doing an excellent job at bringing music and social together. But they must never rest, and constantly innovate, because they could easily fall behind their competition, like <a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a> who some argue that they have a better interface.</p>
