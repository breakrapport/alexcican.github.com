				<h1>MagicToys</h1>
				<h2>MagicToys is a company that sells physical magic products. I was hired to designed and develop a complete e-commerce solution that would act as a platform for selling and promoting physical as well as digital goods.</h2>

						<p class="text">&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked with Alex for the creation of an e-commerce website for my company. I liked the professional and powerful combination of the strong graphic impact with the elegance of the design of this designer. Another positive point is the smart way of exchanging ideas and also the ease of contacting him by phone and email despite the far distance.&#8221; - Dario Lops</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h2>Concept Idea</h2>
				<p>The client requested that I design a full e-commerce solution for his business. Up until now, he used to sell magic products offline, by going to different fairs and presenting magic products to the audience around. He saw an opportunity of expanding his business online and decided to go with it. Moreover he wanted to sell digital products as well, such as video tutorials.</p>

				<p>For the design, apart from wanting a commercial and simple layout, he left it entirely up to me to come up with design ideas. The final layout selected was a two column centre layout.</p>

				<p>Some features of the website are: subscribe to the weekly newsletter, check for new products, add, edit and remove products from cart (visual feedback), search for a product, change quantity in cart, 1 step checkout, inventory checking, send e-mail confirmation on purchase, pay for products via &#8220;PayPal&#8221;, &#8220;Credit Card&#8221;, &#8220;Bank Transfer&#8221; or &#8220;Pay at Collection&#8221;, automatically generate receipts, sell and send digital products via e-mail, provide statistics of purchases, ability to add periodical discount codes, check if discount code is valid, contact MagicToys and more.</p>

				<h2 class="title">Production</h2>
				<p>I chose to use WordPress as the backbone of the site. By purchasing a plugin called <a href="http://www.phpurchase.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PHPurchase</a>, it would make handling of the products, invoices and automatic e-mailing, easier. I decided to go with PHPurchase (instead of other e-commerce plugins), because of its ability to customise the look of it completely. It was a bit of a pain to edit the plugin due to the many PHP files and complex coding but I finally pulled it off successfully.</p>

				<p>The website was coded in valid xHTML Strict 1.0 and CSS 3. Once all the design elements were in place, it was then transposed into PHP and saved as a WordPress theme. I spent a significant amount of time on creating a nice visually pleasing menu in CSS3 that also works in IE (by adding images, screenshot on the right). </p>

				<p><a href="../images/uploads//2011/07/full_cart.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/uploads/2011/07/full_cart-440x194.jpg" alt="full cart" title="full cart" width="440" height="194" /></a><br/>
				When adding a product to the cart, from an empty state (with empty cart icon) the cart was updated to a full state indicating the total price (excluding shipping) and the number of products. Once a product was added to the cart, a button appeared below leading you to the checkout page if clicked. Furthermore, because the cart was in the upper right corner, it could be easily missed, so when a product was added to the cart, a message bar slid down and notified you that the product was added successfully.</p>

				<p>I wrote a tutorial on how to create that message bar. Check it out if you want: <a href="http://www.sicanstudios.com/display-top-message-twitter/">Display top message bar on click like Twitter &rarr;</a></p>

				<p>The cart was designed with cookies, so the product would remain in the cart even after you would close the website (it would save the session until you closed the browser). This was a usability feature I wanted to include in this website and useful in case the Internet connection breaks down, or you close the tab of the browser accidentally.</p>

				<p><a href="../images/uploads//2011/07/discount_code.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/uploads//2011/07/discount_code-440x156.jpg" alt="discount code" title="discount code" width="440" height="156" /></a><br/>
				The client had a marketing idea to keep customers coming back: When you purchased a product, a discount code was issued with the product giving you 10% &ndash; 40% off on your next purchase. Furthermore, he also wanted to have periodical discount codes, for example during Halloween. I provided a discount code checker that informed the user if the code they inserted was valid and how much discount they would get. If the code entered would not match the database records of active discount codes, it would display an error message.</p>

				<p><a href="../images/uploads//2011/07/checkout_page.jpg" class="img"><img src="../images/uploads//2011/07/checkout_page-440x442.jpg" alt="checkout page" title="checkout page" width="440" height="442" /></a><br/>
				The cart page and checkout page were completely redesigned to suit the needs of this magic product selling website. I tried making the process as easy and intuitive as possible. In the shopping cart page you can make changes to the cart and once you are done you click on the central big button &#8220;checkout&#8221;. That button, transfers you to the checkout page. From there, you can review your cart and select a payment method from the drop-down list.</p>

				<p>In the contact form, if the fields completed were incorrect, using jQuery for error-checking, it would display errors with red and request the user to correct those fields. Moreover, checking the fields again in the PHP file is necessary, in case someone having JavaScript disabled tries to &#8220;trick&#8221; the system entering phony details.</p>

				<p>In conclusion, this was a challenging project and I learned a lot in the e-commerce website design and development field. This made me gain confidence that I can develop from scratch, an impeccable fully working e-commerce website in a little over a month.</p>
