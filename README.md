<h1>This is the data for my website</h1>
<p>Got tired of hosting companies (last one was a VPS Linode), their crappy customer support and losing files (got hacked, files got erased &#61; no website). So, now I host my website on GitHub from my DropBox folder (so I can have access to it from anywhere).</p>

<p>I wrote about how I moved my websites <a href="http://blog.sicanstudios.com/post/guide-hosting-website-dropbox-github">in this article</a>.</p>

<p>Would love it if I could host PHP files as well. The <a href="http://blog.sicanstudios.com">Blog</a> is hosted on Dropbox using <a href="http://scriptogr.am">Scriptogram</a>.</p>
