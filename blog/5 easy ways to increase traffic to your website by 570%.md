Title: 5 easy ways to increase traffic to your website by 570%
Slug: increase-traffic-website

In this tutorial I’m going to share with you my personal experience of how I managed to go from an average of 94 unique visitors per day to an average of 630 visitors per day and still growing. I divided the tutorial in 5 easy steps for you to follow.

##Minimum Effort

Due to the lack of free time I had, and still have, I did the bare minimum to increase my website’s exposure. Such methods like advertising your website, guest posting, performing A/B testing and studies, building connections, link trading and many other didn’t apply to me. By applying the [Pareto principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle "Pareto Principle on Wikipedia"), I managed to get the biggest results by doing the bare minimum. In this tutorial, I’ll explain exactly the methods I used, step by step.

##1. Start a blog

Nowadays, starting a blog is a great way to connect with your readers, increase your website’s visitors and get your name out in the blogosphere. That’s why many companies have started a blog and they regularly post on it. Furthermore, connecting the blog with some sort of social network (Twitter or Facebook) is another trending solution which is being used by many companies and individuals.

With time, search engines will index your blog’s content. As a result, more and more visitors will be visiting your website after searching on search engines topics that you’ve covered in your blog.

When you’ve finally decided that you want to start a blog, the next step is to decide your [niche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market "Niche on Wikipedia"). This is very important as it will help you create a name for yourself and be seen as an expert in that niche.

_For example Darren Rowse is known as a successful blogger blogging on [Problogger](http://www.problogger.net/ "Problogger")._

Make sure that your blog is well designed, easy to use and navigate (add a search function), accessible ([validate](http://validator.w3.org/ "Validator") your website and fix those HTML errors) and that you post frequently on it. Schedule at least once per week to post on the blog and stick to that schedule.

And lastly: don’t start a blog just for the sake of it! People will notice! Write passionately and post great content!

##2. Content is king, or is it?

Ensure that you deliver high quality original content on your blog. Make your content easy to understand and minimize grammatical or spelling errors. By writing high quality posts, other people will link to your article, resulting in your post and blog to be read by even more people.

Based on my experience, it usually creates a “snowball” effect which goes like this: influential people read your post and if they like it, they go and talk about it. Many people listen and now then they come to read the post resulting in them going and talking about the blog post to their audience and so on.

But still, there are tons of great blogs with awesome content but they don’t get the deserved attention and nobody reads them.

That’s because you have to make sure that your content has solid foundations where to sit on. Things like attractive web design, valid and accessible code, being active in social media, fast website loading times, good SEO (explained later on), big readership matters (created over time) and can help your content market itself easier.

Mack Collier writes great about this topic [here](http://moblogsmoproblems.blogspot.com/2009/06/idea-that-content-is-king-in-blogging.html "Content is King on Blogging").

##3. SEO

If you don’t know what it is, [read about it here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization "SEO Definition").  Although many disagree, for me this is one of the best methods I managed to increase my unique visitors.

How? By improving my search engine rankings.

How do you improve your search engine rankings?

Make sure your page title is relevant to the content of the page. In the `<title>` attribute, insert the most important keyword first and then additional details. Example:

	BEFORE: <title>MySiteIsAwesome.com | About Me Page</title>
	AFTER: <title>About Me Page | MySiteIsAwesome.com</title>

Ensure that you have included a meta description which is unique for each page. The description is picked up by search engines and is displayed when they present that page in the search results.

Add `<alt>` and `<title>` attributes to images.

Within your post, make sure you include headings `(h1, h2, h3)` and add relevant keywords inside them. It helps search engine crawlers understand what the page is about. Use headings in order of importance. The `<h1>` tag is for the title and the main subject of your post, the `<h2>` tag is for the secondary point, or subheading, and so on. Though, now with HTML5 you can have several `<h1>` tags within the same page:

	<section>
		<h1>Title of this section</h1>

		<article>
			<h1>Title of this article</h1>
		</article>
	</section>

Last but not least, include a sitemap in your website. Sitemaps inform search engine crawlers: 1) which pages are available for crawling and 2) the structure of the website.

##4. Freebies!

Everyone loves free stuff! So give it to them!

It can be anything: icons, wallpapers, games, software, subscriptions, entertainment, advice, demos and tryouts or even useful information. It is a very powerful way of attracting people. Many companies offer demos of their product to try out. After testing, you decide that like the product but in order to enable the full features, you have to purchase it. So you do. It’s that simple.

Many game companies proceed in the same way as well: they offer a demo of their game for you to try, experience the new features and then, after you are convinced of the high quality, you are determined to purchase their game.

On a blog, you come to read meaningful, quality posts and tutorials that solve your problems. If you’ve found an answer to your problem, you will visit the blog again or even subscribe to it.

Where’s the blogger’s gain in this? Well apart from the personal satisfaction of having a voice and being heard (becoming an expert in your field), if you have advertisements on the blog you can also earn some income. Many bloggers have quit their job and became full time bloggers.

So start giving something for free today! You’ll see the difference!

##5. Post loads of images

Adding images is a great way to earn extra traffic! Remember to optimise your alt tag and title tag and don’t overfill them with irrelevant keywords. Search engines are clever; they match the keywords to the text associated with the image and discard the irrelevant images.

##Conclusion

There are certainly a lot more ways to increase your website traffic, but for me, these are the ones that worked best! Here’s a list with some useful resources and more ways to increase traffic, in case you want to do some more reading:
