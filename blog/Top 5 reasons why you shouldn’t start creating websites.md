Title: Top 5 reasons why you shouldn’t start creating websites
Slug: creating-websites

The Internet is expanding; that’s a no-brainer. And with it, the market and the business opportunities. More than ever, I see ads claiming to show you how to make shitloads of money from working at home, via the Internet. One way to do that is to work as a freelance website designer/developer. This post is intended to expose the risks of this industry and what I’ve learned from working in the field.

In this post, I assume you will be dealing with both the design and the development of the websites yourself, as I have.

##Reason #1 – It takes time

It takes a long time to master the skills of HTML and CSS. Yes, you may learn them in a flash (they’re easy languages to learn) but it takes time to master them. Don’t forget that you also have to learn how to design a website, how to compose the elements on the page, what colours to use, what fonts to use, what backgrounds, and the list is endless. At the beginning it is very hard to get it right. With time, practice and experience, you train your eye to see these things which help you create “better” websites. Not to mention that you can skyrocket your hourly rate.

But, the constant improvement and growth of technology makes it even harder for you to keep up. The browsers constantly change, new ones also emerge. So, you might be thrilled that you just finished the website and just for fun you decide to test your website on other browsers; you discover that in one browser particular browser (no names!), your website isn’t displaying properly. On you go in search for hacks and solutions. 

Mobile phones are entering the game now, meaning that you also have to learn how to optimise your website for mobile phones — small file sizes like serving two types of images for fast loading times, stripped and minimalistic design, keeping in mind the small screen (legibility) and many more… — HTML5 along with CSS3 are entering the arena. Go find out more about these.

More companies and individuals nowadays want to publish their content by themselves. They demand that you use a CMS (Content Management System) to develop their website on. On you go to learn PHP, MySQL, how to create a theme, what CMS to use, how to install it etc. Because of the trend, companies now also want to be active on social media, so they request from you to create them a customised page for their Facebook Fan page on which visitors will land first. They read somewhere that this would help them expand their brand and engage more with their visitors, increasing thus their fan base. On you go to learn FBML (Facebook Markup Language). Lastly they insist in displaying their Twitter updates on their website. On you go in search for ways to do that.

There’s a strong possibility that by the time you’ve learned and mastered all those skills, the trends would have changed. So, you are now left behind, watching helplessly how others who ride the “trend wave” get all the clients.

There is a hidden pitfall, which goes by: “I don’t follow trends”. Well buddy, as far as I’m concerned, you can design your website like it’s 1999 but don’t expect to lock-in any clients… Maybe your daddy will find them for you.

##Reason #2 – The competition

I’m telling you up front: the competition is fierce! I often feel that the Internet is filled with website designers and developers! Wherever I turn my head — digitally of course — there is a dude or a dudette offering website design services. Now, whether they know how to design and develop a website is irrelevant. Yes, completely irrelevant. Because there are many clients; hell, the majority of them who want a website created for the minimum amount of money. It doesn’t matter if it’s going to cost them more in the long run. They just don’t see the forest behind the tree. And to share with you a trade secret: avoid clients that say they don’t have the budget! They’re a pain in the arse to work with. I figured a way to repel those timewasters. In my contact form, I added a “what’s your budget” option if the message is work related. Problem solved!

And get this: there is always going to be someone who can do the job, faster, or cheaper or even better than you. This applies to any business. But in the website creation business, the amount of people who can do it faster and cheaper than you is infinitely larger!

Frankly, it is too crowded and we don’t need _another one_ “joining us”! Don’t get me wrong, join the website development business, but don’t say I didn’t warn you and also don’t expect to become a millionaire…

##Reason #3 – There are no standards

There are certain standards and quality controls that you need to follow when creating a laptop for example. From the client’s perspective, there is also a standard of _price versus quality_. You know that if you want to buy a good laptop you are required to spend something in the range of $600 – $1000. If you want a “top” laptop you will go for an Apple MacBook or an Alienware and expect to pay somewhere in the range of $1200 – $7000. My point is that you can estimate the value for money. Furthermore, you can even consult with the plethora of websites that review laptops and choose the best laptop based on their tests, maximising your value for money and minimising risk.

This kind of standard, the baseline price you need to pay for a quality product, is inexistent with websites. You can pay something from $0 ([carbonmade.com](http://carbonmade.com/), [webs.com](http://www.webs.com/), [freewebsites.com](http://www.freewebsites.com/), [wix.com](http://www.wix.com/)) to $45 – $159 (PSD to HTML: [xhtmlchop.com](http://www.xhtmlchop.com/), [psd2html.com](http://www.psd2html.com/)) to $15000 (for a full e-commerce hand crafted, custom made with extra benefits). There is no price point limit! Apart from this being confusing to your clients, it is also confusing to you, the developer. You don’t know how much to charge; hell you aren’t even sure if you should charge by the hour or by the project!

To expand an aforementioned point: quality controls. There aren’t any in the websites’ world. You can create a website without a `DOCTYPE` as long as it renders, it’s OK; now, _gimme your money!_ No matter how crappy the coding is, if you deliver, the client won’t say no. That is until they realise that blind users can’t browse the website or that older versions of browsers don’t even render the website (I’m not saying websites should be exactly the same across all browsers; that’s impossible). Too late for that though; the bird has left the nest.

There is another possibility that the client could be well informed and demand from you to ensure that the website renders in other browsers, deals with long loading times, has a mobile version, has a `SEO` thought construction, improves conversion rates, and many more. This is what separates the professionals from the amateurs. Here is where true professionals can shine, in a PRO medium. The downside is that there aren’t many clients like that.

Want to join this chaotic business? Be my guest! But again, don’t say I didn’t warn you!

##Reason #4 – The Client

This one is tied in with the previous reason, the _lack of standards_. Because of a utopian perception of things, the client assumes that they can ask for the moon and the stars and be given to them. Moreover, they make that outrageous request and offer to repay you with the equivalent of an average car. As soon as you say that it’s impossible and that you need at least three average cars to fulfill their request, they threaten to go to someone else. Now it depends on you; if you are low on cash you will suck up and do the job, whereas if you are a kick-ass person — a starving kick-ass person or not, it doesn’t matter — you will show them the finger and move on. There is one personal trait you need to improve in this kind of business: dealing with clients. Sure, bad clients exist anywhere but if you join this business you will discover that there is no shortage of them here.

##Reason #5 – It can get lonely

Being a one man army, jack of all trades can become tiresome at some point. Working infinite hours in front of a computer (developer, designer), dealing with money (accountant), dealing with problems (IT support), dealing with clients (secretary), etc. can exhaust you in no time. As you can see, you need to develop many qualities and have strong character. There won’t be anyone behind you (or “above” you) checking to see if you’ve done the work. Not to mention that your work/life balance will be disrupted. But if you are like me and realised that you can get more done by eliminating distractions such as coffee breaks, telephone interruptions, meetings, colleagues, then this profession might be worth another look.
