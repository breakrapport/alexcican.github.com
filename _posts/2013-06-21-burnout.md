You know that feeling when you’ve been working a long time on something and you get burned out. You don’t have the energy to keep going, and you need a break. Some say that as long as you work normal hours, and not push yourself you’ll be fine.

##Beginners beware
Here’s the thing though. In the beginning, when you’re starting out, you need to work your ass off. I don’t condone workaholism but you need to burn the midnight oil and work long hours, in order to improve your skills and become good.

It’s only by going through a [volume of work](http://sicanstudios.com/post/doing-work/) that you will close that gap and your work will be as good as your ambitions.

Moreover, I don’t consider designing to be work that I can switch off when I go home. So in a sense I’m not a workaholic, I just design a lot. And you should feel the same too. It’s fine if you have a boring 9-5 job, that pays the rent, and you can shut it off when you get home. But whatever you really want do in your life—your calling—shouldn’t feel like work.

##Avoid the burn
But I feel you. I have experienced this burnout. To solve this issue without going AWOL, you just have to **adjust your design process** a bit. For example you can switch from designing desktop websites to designing mobile websites for a while. Keep doing that, until you get that itch to start again and you are *fit* to get back on the horse. 

Another solution is to **alternate between** other creative fields; for me it’s photography and video. At the end of the day I’m still being productive and seizing the day. I’m still creating.

Creating is a state I’m constantly in. And you can’t burnout a state. You can’t say *“I’m burned out from breathing too much”*…
